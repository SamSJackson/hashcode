value projects as points per day 

importance:


top fraction = score, minStartDate
bottom fraction = averageLevel, num_roles, duration
constant coefficient for each variable 
formula = ((h*score + i*minStartDate) / (u*duration + p*averageLevel + t*num_roles)))


how to assign roles:
give a value to project with formula


when runnable:
	

good things:
	short duration
	low level requirements


bad things:
	lots of people
	long duration
	high level requirements
